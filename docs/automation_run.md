## List Automation Runs

```
files_sdk.automation_run.list({
  "automation_id": 1
})
```

### Parameters

* `cursor` (string): Used for pagination.  When a list request has more records available, cursors are provided in the response headers `X-Files-Cursor-Next` and `X-Files-Cursor-Prev`.  Send one of those cursor value here to resume an existing list from the next available record.  Note: many of our SDKs have iterator methods that will automatically handle cursor-based pagination.
* `per_page` (int64): Number of records to show per page.  (Max: 10,000, 1,000 or less is recommended).
* `sort_by` (object): If set, sort records by the specified field in either `asc` or `desc` direction. Valid fields are `automation_id`, `created_at` or `status`.
* `filter` (object): If set, return records where the specified field is equal to the supplied value. Valid fields are `status` and `automation_id`. Valid field combinations are `[ automation_id, status ]`.
* `automation_id` (int64): Required - ID of the associated Automation.
