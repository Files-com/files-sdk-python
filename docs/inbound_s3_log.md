## List Inbound S3 Logs

```
files_sdk.inbound_s3_log.list()
```

### Parameters

* `cursor` (string): Used for pagination.  When a list request has more records available, cursors are provided in the response headers `X-Files-Cursor-Next` and `X-Files-Cursor-Prev`.  Send one of those cursor value here to resume an existing list from the next available record.  Note: many of our SDKs have iterator methods that will automatically handle cursor-based pagination.
* `per_page` (int64): Number of records to show per page.  (Max: 10,000, 1,000 or less is recommended).
* `filter` (object): If set, return records where the specified field is equal to the supplied value. Valid fields are `operation`, `status`, `path`, `client_ip` or `created_at`. Valid field combinations are `[ operation ]`, `[ status ]`, `[ path ]`, `[ client_ip ]`, `[ created_at ]`, `[ operation, status ]`, `[ operation, path ]`, `[ operation, client_ip ]`, `[ operation, created_at ]`, `[ status, path ]`, `[ status, client_ip ]`, `[ status, created_at ]`, `[ path, client_ip ]`, `[ path, created_at ]`, `[ client_ip, created_at ]`, `[ operation, status, path ]`, `[ operation, status, client_ip ]`, `[ operation, status, created_at ]`, `[ operation, path, client_ip ]`, `[ operation, path, created_at ]`, `[ operation, client_ip, created_at ]`, `[ status, path, client_ip ]`, `[ status, path, created_at ]`, `[ status, client_ip, created_at ]`, `[ path, client_ip, created_at ]`, `[ operation, status, path, client_ip ]`, `[ operation, status, path, created_at ]`, `[ operation, status, client_ip, created_at ]`, `[ operation, path, client_ip, created_at ]` or `[ status, path, client_ip, created_at ]`.
* `filter_gt` (object): If set, return records where the specified field is greater than the supplied value. Valid fields are `created_at`.
